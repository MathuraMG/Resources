For adding images in your documentation, follow the below steps.
1. Upload the folder containing the images into your repository using the "Upload Files" option.
2. Get the link to the image (it will be something like github.com/username/reponame/folder/image.png)
3. Once you have that, the syntax to have it in markdown will be **"[alt text](image link)"**
